# 🌿 Xenium Data Analysis Training

Welcome to the **Xenium Data Analysis Training Course**!  
This 4-week program introduces the fundamentals of analyzing **10x Genomics Xenium in situ** transcriptomics data using **R** and **Xenium Explorer**.

The course is designed for new researchers and PhD students to gain hands-on experience with Xenium data — from loading raw output to visualizing gene expression, clustering cells, and identifying marker genes.

## 📘 Course Overview

**Instructor:** Dr. Min-Yao Jhu  
**Duration:** 4 weeks (1-hour guided session + ~3 days of independent practice per week)  
**Tools:** R (Seurat v5, Xenium Ranger) and Xenium Explorer  
**Prerequisites:** Basic R and single-cell analysis experience  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

1. Understand the structure and components of Xenium output files  
2. Load Xenium data into R using Seurat functions  
3. Visualize spatial gene expression using R and Xenium Explorer  
4. Perform clustering and dimensionality reduction  
5. Detect and interpret marker genes for specific spatial domains
